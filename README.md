# Tutorial Project 6
Hello BIOL 202 Students! Please enjoy the following R Tutorial. To begin, go to the 'files' tab in the lower right hand panel of RStudio and click on the file named "Project01.Rmd".  This will open up the tutorial file in the upper left hand panel.  Follow along with the tutorial from the top of the file, starting with the 'Introduction' section.  Any plain text following section headings should be read through first.  Each 'code chunk' (grey code chunk sections with a little green triangle in the upper right hand corner) should be run through line by line.  This can be done by clicking at the end of each line, starting from the top, and hitting 'Ctrl + Enter'.  Any blank code chunks will require your input of code.  Follow along with the accompanying instructions to figure out what code is needed.
